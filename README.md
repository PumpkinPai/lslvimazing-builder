# LSLVIMAZING BUILDER
LSL-vim syntax plugin creator

See http://github.com/pumpkinpai/lslvimazing for the plugin

Grabs latest lsl functions from the Linden Lab wiki and builds the syntax files as a vim plugin.

You probably don't need this if you just want the LSL plugin.  I run updates every few days and send them to the lslvimazing repo.

**TODO**
- [x] Make it work!
- [ ] Add Features!
  - [ ] Add snippet scraping
  - [ ] Add snippet functionality with iabbrev
  - [ ] Add option to autosave lsl files locally with decent names
